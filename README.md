# basil-python-project
In my EID-101 class we worked on a HydroKit where we would plant basil in a hydroponics system and monitor it with an Arduino and some sensors. We then worked on a visualization of our data using python. In my python project, I used the data that was collected on the CO2 levels throughout the past few hours. I used that data to make a graph with the CO2 level on the y-axis and timestamp on the x-axis.
